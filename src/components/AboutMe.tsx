        Hi, I'm Alexander, a web developer from South Africa. I specialize in front-end development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and have experience with PHP and SQL for back-end work.
        Iâ€™m passionate about creating responsive, user-friendly websites and continually improving my skills in Node.js and TypeScript.
        </p>
        <p className="about-text">
        Iâ€™m eager to work on projects that are meaningful and have a real impact.
        Iâ€™m constantly learning new technologies and development practices to stay up-to-date and continue growing as a developer.
